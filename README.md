# AirTraj-Code
This is code we use to account for drag in projectile motions for calculating points for the Science Olympiad Air Trajectory Event.

The variable we account for are (R)adius of ball, (M)ass of ball, (C)oefficient of Drag, (v0) for initial velocity (calculated using a photogate and diameter of ball), and tube lengths to determine x0 and y0 (since these change as your angle changes (basic trig)).

ðŸª²Add a way of getting points for elevated targets

## Battle of Valley Forge
Points did not hit. We did not account for "Newbie Error."

## Columbia 1/26/25
This is our official code for Teams C, D, & E. The far target (261 in) was hit twice. The near target (98 in, 0.8 elevated) point hit the ceiling twice. Team E experienced "Newbie Error."

Team C competitor used a metronome to standardize pulling speed.
